          <p>Community archives are created by members of a specific group with the intention of documenting their shared and lived experiences. Community archives are created to add and preserve marginalized voices that have been excluded from the historical record. Contrary to traditional archives, community members are involved in every step of the creation of the archive, from defining the scope to describing materials, to providing access. When radical or experimental in form, archives can act as sites of resistance to further advance movement-building and solidarity. This can happen by preserving, and working with our communities to actively document the histories and stories of our own groups of affinity or place. Our communities are the true knowledge-holders.</p>
